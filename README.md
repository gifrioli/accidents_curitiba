# About

Curitiba is a city that has a unique public transportation system. However, pedestrian and cyclist accidents have become common. Some of these accidents involve teenagers performing the ‚Äúrabeira‚Äù challenge on buses. This project aims to show data related to the accidents and the locations on bus lines where they occur.

# Data

The data was obtained through the Access to Information Law from Curitiba Urbanization (URBS). The accident records were sent in PDF format, so I used the Natural PDFs library to convert the data into spreadsheets. The numbers were analyzed in Python using the Pandas library.

# Visualization

The project is on a simple visualization website and includes maps and charts for classroom learning. I created two D3 visualizations, a bar charts and dot plots, and a map made using QGIS, Illustrator and ai2html.

# Challenges

I am still learning to create maps, so they are not as clean or polished as they could be. The appearance of the D3 visualizations could also be greatly improved. This is just the beginning of a project that could be further developed.
